From there, we’ll establish a regular session schedule based on those goals. To kick off this journey, you can either email me directly or fill out a brief form. This form is designed to help you reflect on your current state and clarify how we can best begin. In your personal message, you can share your concerns, and I’ll provide you with a customized plan tailored to your needs. If you find that the planner isn’t sufficient, we can seamlessly transition into virtual therapy sessions, ensuring you receive the support necessary to thrive. Your path to healing starts with this simple step—let’s embark on it together!"
